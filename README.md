# CS-261-Portfolio-Project

Portfolio Project for CS261, the only project that we were allowed to share.  
These are python files that implement directed and undirected graph ADTS (advanced data types).


We were tasked with implementing the following:

for undirected graphs:
- add_vertex()
- add_edge()
- remove_edge()
- remove_vertex()
- get_vertices()
- get_edges()
- is_valid_path()
- dfs()
- bfs()
- count_connected_components()
- has_cycle()

for the directed graph:
- add_vertex()
- add_edge()
- remove_edge()
- get_vertices()
- get_edges()
- is_valid_path()
- dfs()
- bfs()
- has_cycle()
- dijkstra()
